# Client discovery template

Copy this into a doc or ticket per client **before** cloning the starter. Fill every section; use the mapping table at the bottom to decide what to change in `.env` vs the prompt.

**Client name:** ___________________  
**Project slug (repo name):** ___________________  
**Date:** ___________________

---

## 1. Business context

| Field | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| Company name (spoken) | |
| Agent name (spoken) | |
| Industry / use case (e.g. real estate, lead qualifier, dental intake) | |
| Inbound, outbound, or both? | |
| Who calls? (customers, leads, patients, tenants, etc.) | |

---

## 2. Call goals

Check all that apply and add notes:

- [ ] Answer FAQs only (no save required)
- [ ] Capture lead / intake for follow-up
- [ ] Qualify leads (hot / warm / cold)
- [ ] Book appointments / showings
- [ ] Transfer hot leads to a human
- [ ] Outbound campaign (dial list)
- [ ] Other: ___________________

**Primary success metric:** What makes this call a win? (e.g. "qualified lead saved with budget + timeline", "showing booked", "FAQ answered in under 2 min")

**What should never happen?** (e.g. quote prices, give legal advice, promise same-day service)

---

## 3. Conversation script (high level)

**Opening:** How should the agent greet? (or use default from `COMPANY_NAME` + `AGENT_NAME`)

**Core questions (in order, one at a time):**

1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

**When to save a record:** After which info is collected?

**When to book:** What triggers scheduling?

**When to transfer:** What qualifies a handoff?

**When to end call:** Goodbye triggers only, or also after save?

---

## 4. Data to capture

| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 Business context | 2–3 | Clone repo; `COMPANY_NAME`, `AGENT_NAME`, `AGENT_LABEL` |
| 2 Call goals | 4 | `# Role and Objective`, `# Conversation Flow`, `# Safety` |
| 3 Conversation script | 4 | `# Conversation Flow`, `# Tools` |
| 4 Data to capture | 4 | `# Entity Capture`; tool fields in `save_call_record` |
| 5 Integrations | 3 | `.env` feature flags (see [Configuration](../CONFIGURATION.md)) |
| 6 Tone, voice, and language | 3, 5 | `.env` tone/voice/language/accent; optional `WELCOME_MESSAGE` |
| 7 Deploy and ops | 7 | Twilio webhook, Cloud Run, ngrok for dev |
